# CLI Bio Links - Business Card

Generate easily your business card through the terminal (for nerds 🤓).

## Run my business card

```bash
  npx pH7BioLinks
```

If you wish to reuse it, you can easily update the links in the `data.json` file (the script will read from there 😄).

If you edit the script on your machine, you will have to run `npm link` and then run `pH7BioLinks` in your terminal.
